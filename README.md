## Inspiration

Small tasks add up through the work day, and for me, _if it doesn't get written down, it doesn't get done_. In search of a solution, I tried countless productivity apps. Some were too feature-heavy and just made things more complicated, while others were simple, but lacked essential functions and were uninspiring to use. 

Despite my efforts, I found myself returning again and again to the basic list I kept in a OneNote page, where I would highlight my tasks based on their urgency: Red for tasks due today, Yellow for tasks with an upcoming due date, and Green for optional tasks with no due date (see below). Throughout the day, I would add, change, or delete tasks from the list and update the highlight colors accordingly.

From a productivity standpoint, this system worked very well, but using it was quite tedious and visually abrasive. I knew that the method was good, but I wanted an app that would remove friction from the process and provide a more visually compelling backdrop to my work day--so I built one.


## Usage

The frontend was written in TypeScript and built with React and Tailwind CSS. Authentication and User identity is handled by Firebase and integrated through custom React hooks. The backend is written in JavaScript and built with Express.js (Node.js) and connects to a MongoDB Atlas cluster which utilizes Atlas triggers for CRON updates to records.
