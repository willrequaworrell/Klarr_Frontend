## Inspiration

Small tasks add up through the work day, and for me, _if it doesn't get written down, it doesn't get done_. In search of a solution, I tried countless productivity apps. Some were too feature-heavy and just made things more complicated, while others were simple, but lacked essential functions and were uninspiring to use. 

Despite my efforts, I found myself returning again and again to the basic list I kept in a OneNote page, where I would highlight my tasks based on their urgency: Red for tasks due today, Yellow for tasks with an upcoming due date, and Green for optional tasks with no due date (see below). Throughout the day, I would add, change, or delete tasks from the list and update the highlight colors accordingly.

From a productivity standpoint, this system worked very well, but using it was quite tedious and visually abrasive. I knew that the method was good, but I wanted an app that would remove friction from the process and provide a more visually compelling backdrop to my work day--so I built one.
